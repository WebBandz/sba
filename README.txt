Project for Week 5 SBA submission.

Just a simple website about coffee utilizing 5 pages: Home, About, Numbers, and Contact.  
There are three sections in the index giving a description of each coffee and a link that
takes you to a wiki page.  At the bottom is a visitor counter which uses javascript to tally
visitors.  About page simple and expounds on internal/inline styling.  Numbers page presents a
simple chart about the business figures.  Contact has two forms: one using a description box and
the other utilizing a drop-down and user email.  The page utilizes 3 web fonts taken from 
Google Fonts.  Everything is made plain through the style sheet styles.css    

Can also be obtained through github.  Please visit https://github.com/WebBandz/sba.git.

Thank you!
